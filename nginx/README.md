# Day 1 Exercise

Welcome! In this exercise, you will test your knowledge of Dockerfile. The task at hand is pretty simple. 

You have an `index.html` file that you need to serve as your website through `Nginx`. In order to achieve this, you need to do the following:

1. Write a Dockerfile with Nginx as your base;
2. Replace the contents of `/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html` file with the given `index.html`;
3. Build and tag the docker image.
4. Run the image and map it to port 80 of your computer.

If you are successful, then `http://localhost` should show you the contents of the given `index.html`.

Please try to complete it on your own. This will test the knowledge you gained on Day 1 discussion. If you still cannot do it, please consult us during the Day 2 of the workshop.

Cheers!
