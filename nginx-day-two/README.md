# Day 2 Exercise

Congratulations as you have made until day 2! 

For day 2, we shall focus on docker-compose! For this exercise, your goals are the following:

- make a `docker-compose.yml` file for the `nginx` project;
- build the `Dockerfile` of this folder using compose;
- map containers port `80` with your machines port `80`;
- create a volume map between this folder and `/usr/share/nginx/html/` so that when you change the contents of `index.html` file, you can see the change immediately.

If you become successful in achieving all these steps, this assignment is complete!
